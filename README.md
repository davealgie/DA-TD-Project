# ToDo Project
This project is a Full stack Web application which acts as a system for creating and manipulating a To Do List or short for TDL, which will allow us to add, edit, read and delete to dos. The application was created using Spring Boot and It has been tested using Unit, Integration and Selenium tests.

# Getting Started
In order to run and test the application you firstly require Java(v1.8 onward), MySql, Eclipse(recommended), Visual Studio Code(reccommended), Spring Boot and Maven installed your personal computer. Links for downloading them are provided on the Built With section down below.

# Prerequisites
In order to get our application setup, we need to follow the below instructions.

(1) Clone this repository to your local machine.

(2) Open the backend folder with Eclipse IDE.

(3) After the project is loaded, you should be able to see it on the Package Explorer window placed on the left hand side.

(4) Expand the project folder and you will be able to see a series of folders. The main ones that we need to focus are:

src/main/java --> It is where our application code resides.

src/main/resources --> We keep the resources needed for our main java code, for example our database properties connection.

src/test/java --> It is where all the testing resides

(5) Right-click the project folder and click Run As > Spring Boot App

(6) The Spring Boot App will start the server on port 8080.

(7) After that, It is time to open the front-end part of our application and run it on a browser. To do so, open the project folder from visual studio code. Go to index.html, right click from the document and select Open With Live server(This takes into account, your visual studio code has the extension of live server installed).

(8) The application will open from the browser and we are ready to play with it. You will be presented with a Homepage and a To Do list page.
